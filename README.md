# Code for "Considering what we know and what we don't know"

This repo contains all the code and data used to generate the results in a manuscript under blind review.

- The main model results are generated by model/main.jl
- Sensitivity analyses are generated by model/sensitivity.jl and then plotted in model/sensitivity_analysis.jl
- Attempts at model fitting start with model/run_sobol.jl
- All main-text plots and statistics are generated by analysis.R

After publication, the authors will be available to help anyone use the data and/or code.
